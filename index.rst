Introduction
================
 
 
In the following document and information to be provided, it is related to the installation, the material, and the location of the network points, such as fiber optics. This document will present information on the location of the points, quantity, and also the location and quantity of fiber filaments per floor. This document reflects how the physical network of the main building is built and how it is a project still under construction that may undergo changes in the future such as adding connection points and taking out. The materials used were selected for their quality and properties so that the project in its operation works at its maximum performance The fiber optic points single-mode cable was installed since in practice there is no transmission limit, only the equipment that transmits. The UTP S/FTP cable was selected for its properties to work at 10G / base T and all network points will be installed with this type of cable, both for AP and telephone connections. As for everything that is user cord is with UTP cat 6 cable On some occasions, the multimode cable will be installed, only on the occasions that the equipment needs it.
